                      A monokai based dark ChatZilla motif

This motif for ChatZilla [1] is based on the monokai theme for TextMate [2]
and, more specifically, the molokai theme for Vim [3].

It uses CSS animations and transitions without relying on them. This means,
that you can use it in virtually any version of ChatZilla.


                            I N S T A L L A T I O N

Download this package [4] and unpack it. Then open ChatZilla and go to
    ChatZilla > Preferences > Global Settings > Appearance
Under “Motifs” set the path of the current motif to
    <motokai location>/motokai.css


                     E R R O R S :   W H A T   T O   D O ?

If you have spotted an error or incompatibility in the motif, please open a
new issue at the project’s bug tracker [5]. You know about CSS? Great! I’m
open to pull requests. Just fork the project, commit changes and queue a
request.
